# Developer Guide

## Building
- [Java Development Kit](https://openjdk.java.net/) 8
- [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.5
- [PlantUml](http://plantuml.com/) for diagrams
- Recommended [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
  or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer)
  with the following plugins
  - [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
  - [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
- [git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)

#### Maven
- Formats Java, XML, and JSON files
  (See the [Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html))
- Enforces unit test code coverage
- Performs [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/) analysis using Google rules
- Performs [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) analysis
  with [Find Security Bugs](http://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) extensions
- Enforces Git branch naming conventions to support Jira integration

The above build steps can be skipped for use with IDE launch support by disabling the
_standard_ profile, e.g. `mvn -P'!standard' package`

#### git-secrets
git-secrets must be installed and configured to scan for AWS entries and the patterns in
[.git-secrets-patterns](.git-secrets-patterns). Exclusions are managed in
[.gitallowed](.gitallowed).
The [init-git-secrets.sh](src/scripts/init-git-secrets.sh) script can be used to simply set up.

> ###### !!  Mac users
> If using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), use `brew install --HEAD git-secrets` as decribed
> by [this post](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets/issues/65#issuecomment-416382565) to
> avoid issues committing multiple files.

## Tools
`src/scripts` provides tools to support development activities.

> :warning: Review each script before running to ensure you understand exactly what it does.

- `dev-app.sh`
  Run the applilcation locally.

- `init-git-secrets.sh`
  Initializes your clone of this repository to work with git secrets.

- `make-configs.sh`
  Create application configuration for local development.

----

## Running

The Spring application requires
[external configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html)
for environment specific information, such as other service URLs. In production or
production-like environments, configuration is stored in AWS S3 buckets. In local developer
environments, configuration can be `config/` directories that are not maintained in Git. See
a teammate for connection details to developr resources.

See the [configuration guide](configuration.md) for configuring applications in AWS.
